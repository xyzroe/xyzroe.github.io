# Lumi Router

This is fork of [Lumi Router JN5169 firmware](https://github.com/igo-r/Lumi-Router-JN5169) for use with the LM15-SP-WM module used in the Xiaomi Smart Plug (ZNCZ02LM).  
Also it can be used with any other JN5169 based module.

The only difference is the ability to reset the device using a button on DIO 0.  
In the original firmware, all control takes place only through the serial port.

## How to flash

1. Download [JN-SW-4107](https://www.nxp.com/downloads/en/software-support/JN-SW-4107.zip) and install
2. Connect using JP1 to your USB-TTL according to table below:

LM15-SP-WM (JP1) | JN5169 | Function | USB-TTL
--- | --- | --- | ---
1 | DIO 28 | TXD0 | RX
2 | DIO 29 | RXD0 | TX
3 |DIO 22 | SPIMISO | GND  
4 |DIO 9/39 | VDD | 3.3V  
5 |DIO 3 | RESETN | ---
6 |DIO 21/39 | VSS | GND  

3. Download firmware binary to `C:\NXP\ProductionFlashProgrammer` and open console at this folder.
4. Run `JN51xxProgrammer.exe -s COM1 -f LumiRouter_20210707.bin -v -V`

## Reset and join
The device enters join mode in two cases:
  1. When PDM memory is erased
  2. Right after leaving existing network

Long (> 2000ms) clicking on BTN (DIO0 to GND) erases PDM memory.
The device will restart and then automatically join.

## Restart
Close JP1_5 (DIO 3) on GND to restart device.

### Small prehistory
Some time ago I found such modules based on JNN5169 on TaoBao and ordered a couple.

Initially, I planned to use them as development boards to learn and play Zigbee SDK by NXP. I soldered just such a comb for easy installation into a breadboard.

But since they are not very convenient as a development board, it was decided to make routers out of them to expand the Zigbee network.
