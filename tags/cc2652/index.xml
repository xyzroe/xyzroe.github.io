Each one had its strengths — some excelled at MQTT integration, others at web interfaces or specific hardware support — but switching between them or trying to combine features was a hassle. Too many fragmented efforts meant slower progress for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s why I created XZG Firmware. It&amp;rsquo;s a unified solution that brings together the best innovations from various Zigbee gateway projects into one codebase. By consolidating efforts on a single, open-source firmware, we can focus on making it better: more features, better stability, easier setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
