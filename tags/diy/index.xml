Using this device, you can remotely control the power of the USB port to turn on or off the connected device. And also monitor the current voltage and current. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad Zigbee network router.
Frequent use cases: converting a &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; USB lamp into a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; one; connecting modems / sticks / adapters, which sometimes require a power reset; monitoring the current consumption of any connected device.</description></item><item><title>ZigUNO</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/ziguno/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Nov 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/ziguno/</guid><description>ZigUNO is a development board for creating DIY Zigbee devices based on Ebyte E18-MS1 module (CC2530)
Physically, the board is compatible with all shields of the Uno form factor. Finally you can use countless old Arduino shields ðŸ¤£
As a firmware, it is proposed to use:

Also it can be used with any other JN5169 based module.
The only difference is the ability to reset the device using a button on DIO 0.
In the original firmware, all control takes place only through the serial port.

Once upon a time I had an automatic doorphone opener based on: ESP8266, a module for two relays (16A) and a transistor with a strapping.
All this was collected on a bunch of wires and snot made of hot melt glue and looked something like the second photo.</description></item><item><title>Using LED P-10 to display txt file</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/led_p10/</link><pubDate>Tue, 05 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/led_p10/</guid><description>I need to display actual number of tickets in our service support system using big LED display. ðŸš¨
I found LED P10 modules, they are cheap and nice, different colors available. Modules can be connected one by one to make big screen.ðŸ’¡
Then I need some hardware to connect to P-10 and I found VBC-P10 module from great Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ manufacture VK Module. But it has only RS485 and TTL ports, while I need Ethernet so I add Ethernet - RS485 converter.</description></item></channel></rss>
