Same size as popular RS485-TTL module for more compatibility.
As a software part, you can use ebusd with different connection types:
TTL-UART - you need converter that doesn&amp;rsquo;t buffer too much data (CP2102 or FTDI based (like FT232)) üëç ESP8266 / ESP32 enhanced ebusd protocol using ebusd-esp firmware (only Wi-Fi connection now) üéâ Raspberry Pi internal UART port can be used with some preparations,</description></item><item><title>ZigUSB</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/zigusb/</link><pubDate>Wed, 29 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/zigusb/</guid><description>ZigUSB was developed as a device that allows you to control and monitor the power of a device connected via USB.
Using this device, you can remotely control the power of the USB port to turn on or off the connected device. And also monitor the current voltage and current. And it&amp;rsquo;s not a bad Zigbee network router.
Frequent use cases: converting a &amp;ldquo;stupid&amp;rdquo; USB lamp into a &amp;ldquo;smart&amp;rdquo; one; connecting modems / sticks / adapters, which sometimes require a power reset; monitoring the current consumption of any connected device.</description></item><item><title>OpenTherm - TTL</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/ot-ttl/</link><pubDate>Thu, 07 Jul 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/ot-ttl/</guid><description>layout: page hide_title: true hide: true About This adapter is designed to connect an OpenTherm compatible boiler to any TTL port (TTL-USB, ESP8266, ESP32, Arduino, etc).

Also it can be used with any other JN5169 based module.
The only difference is the ability to reset the device using a button on DIO 0.
In the original firmware, all control takes place only through the serial port.

Once upon a time I had an automatic doorphone opener based on: ESP8266, a module for two relays (16A) and a transistor with a strapping.
All this was collected on a bunch of wires and snot made of hot melt glue and looked something like the second photo.</description></item><item><title>oko2mqtt</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/oko2mqtt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/oko2mqtt/</guid><description>During the New Year holidays, we got around to finishing and posting on GitHub the code that allows you to raise your TCP server for OKO devices with state transfer and the ability to control via MQTT. üí°
The MQTT AutoDiscovery mechanism has been implemented, which allows you to automatically add all devices / inputs / outputs / sensors to HomeAssistant. Supports work simultaneously with multiple devices, multithreading.
Currently, support for expansion cards and radio sockets is limited.</description></item><item><title>AirPrint with Epson TM-T20II</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/cups-airprint-epson-tm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/cups-airprint-epson-tm/</guid><description>Ubuntu Xenial Docker image with CUPS and additional Epson TM-T20II drivers It is intended to be used as an AirPrint relay on the Synology NAS, and the local Avahi will be used to advertise printers on the network.
