Also it can be used with any other JN5169 based module.
The only difference is the ability to reset the device using a button on DIO 0.
In the original firmware, all control takes place only through the serial port.

Once upon a time I had an automatic doorphone opener based on: ESP8266, a module for two relays (16A) and a transistor with a strapping.
All this was collected on a bunch of wires and snot made of hot melt glue and looked something like the second photo.</description></item><item><title>oko2mqtt</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/oko2mqtt/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/oko2mqtt/</guid><description>During the New Year holidays, we got around to finishing and posting on GitHub the code that allows you to raise your TCP server for OKO devices with state transfer and the ability to control via MQTT. ðŸ’¡
The MQTT AutoDiscovery mechanism has been implemented, which allows you to automatically add all devices / inputs / outputs / sensors to HomeAssistant. Supports work simultaneously with multiple devices, multithreading.
Currently, support for expansion cards and radio sockets is limited.</description></item><item><title>AirPrint with Epson TM-T20II</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/cups-airprint-epson-tm/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/cups-airprint-epson-tm/</guid><description>Ubuntu Xenial Docker image with CUPS and additional Epson TM-T20II drivers It is intended to be used as an AirPrint relay on the Synology NAS, and the local Avahi will be used to advertise printers on the network.

I found LED P10 modules, they are cheap and nice, different colors available. Modules can be connected one by one to make big screen.ðŸ’¡
Then I need some hardware to connect to P-10 and I found VBC-P10 module from great Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ manufacture VK Module. But it has only RS485 and TTL ports, while I need Ethernet so I add Ethernet - RS485 converter.</description></item><item><title>Alco Post</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/alcopost/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/alcopost/</guid><description>Hardware and software complex of the checkpoint 1 turnstile any 2 controllers ZK MA300 2 alcotesters Alcofor S40 1 speaker and LED unit with voice prompts and mode indication 1 orange pi with python utility for displaying photos and status of passing through the turnstile and writing to the database order of actions: authorization to ZK - alcohol test - in case of an error again - in case of an error, again record the violation and refusal to work (or notification of dismissal, but with permission to exit) - record a successful passage and farewell.</description></item><item><title>WP Matador recovery</title><link>//xyzroe.cc/posts/matador/</link><pubDate>Wed, 30 Sep 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>//xyzroe.cc/posts/matador/</guid><description>Deck ovens for baking bread manufactured by WP Matador.
