A few years ago, I got really into DIY electronics, especially Zigbee devices. I was tinkering with CC2530 chips, flashing firmware, and building custom coordinators — you know, the usual hobbyist stuff. But every time I started a new project, I'd spend hours hunting for the right setup guides, wiring diagrams, or troubleshooting tips scattered across forums, GitHub issues, and random blog posts.

That frustration led me to create the ZigDev Wiki. It's not a massive documentation site; it's a practical mini-wiki where I (and now the community) collect those hard-won nuggets of knowledge. Things like how to set up IAR for Zigbee development, pinouts for common boards, or quick fixes for firmware quirks that drove me crazy.

Why share this? Because Zigbee development can be intimidating for beginners — the ecosystem is fragmented, and good resources are buried. My goal was to make it easier for others to jump in without reinventing the wheel. Over time, it's grown into a hub for tutorials, hardware references, and code snippets that actually work in the real world.

If you're into Zigbee DIY, check it out at [zigdevwiki.github.io](https://zigdevwiki.github.io/). And if you have something useful to add — a link, a PCB design, or a tip — the repo is open on GitHub. Pull requests are welcome; let's build this together.

It's been rewarding to see the community contribute and help each other out. If this helps even one person avoid the headaches I went through, it's worth it.
