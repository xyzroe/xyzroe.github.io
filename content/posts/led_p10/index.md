I need to display actual number of tickets in our service support system using big LED display. ðŸš¨  

I found LED P10 modules, they are cheap and nice, different colors available. Modules can be connected one by one to make big screen.ðŸ’¡  

Then I need some hardware to connect to P-10 and I found [VBC-P10 module](https://vkmodule.com.ua/LED_P10/ledVBC_P10_1R.html) from great Ukrainian ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦ manufacture VK Module. But it has only RS485 and TTL ports, while I need Ethernet so I add [Ethernet - RS485](https://vkmodule.com.ua/Converter/ConverterE485.html) converter. Now I can print numbers on P-10 sending TCP packets to converter IP address. ðŸš€   

Next step is get current active tickets count. I found out that the one way than our service support system can export number of current active tickets is save txt file with this count, each time it changes. ðŸ˜•  

So I wrote small Python script that reads this file very 5 seconds and if any changes make command and send it to P-10. ðŸ“¡  

Runs using PM2. ecosystem.config.js file is very simple. You can find it at the bottom, after the script. ðŸ¥³
